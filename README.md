# MSThesis

This repository contains musical sequences generated in the style of Bach chorales using a *constrained hidden Markov model*, a *constrained Markov chain*, and an *anticipation-RNN*.

The implementation for the Markovian models can be found in the following repo: https://github.com/po-gl/ConstrainedHiddenMarkovModel

The implementation for the anticipation-RNN can be found here: https://github.com/Ghadjeres/Anticipation-RNN

The thesis itself can be found on [ProQuest's website](https://www.proquest.com/openview/aec7887c41bedb8704f3e7e698203fa5/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y) or on my personal site [here](https://porterglines.com/assets/Glines_Porter_MS.pdf).
